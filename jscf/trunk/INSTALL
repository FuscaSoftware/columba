## ========== How to install this framework ==========

First of all: This is a Java Framework and it uses only java tools to compile
and create the framework and the examples.

# ===== What you need =====
You need the cool ant program from apache

http://ant.apache.org

# ===== Hot to compile it =====
To see what targets you can use try

  ant -projecthelp
  
which should list you all neccesary targets you need to compile the framework
and use it.

As the default in the cvs there is only a "build.properties.template" file
included, which is copied to "build.properties" if you run ant the first time
for this project. 

Please edit the newly created "build.properties" and make you own settings.

After finish to made your own setting you can run ant again. The default target
is "build" and creates all classes you need, to use the framework, the example
application and the simple gpg commandline wrapper library.

Try 
  
  ant create-jar
  
to create a jar file which includes the framework, the examples and the
simple gpg-commandline warpper. You can use the jar file simple with the

  java -jar <theFramework>-<version>.jar
  
which sould starts any examples.


Do you have questions or the framework will not be build on your system?
