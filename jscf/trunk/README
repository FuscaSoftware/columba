## ========== What is this? ==========

This is the Java Security Component Framework, short JSCF called.

The framework is written by Thomas Wabner (alias waffel) Copyright (c) 2004.

The framework can be used to add drivers which supporting sign, verify, 
decrypt and encrypt operations about a security device. The device can be a 
hardwaredevice or a normal software like gpg. 

A example implementation and a gpg commadline driver is included in the 
framework. Thus if you have gpg installed you can just start to use the 
framework and adding security operation simple and fast to your java
application.

The idea to the framework is borned while i am try to implement gpg functions
into the cool email client columba. If you have a framework and not only one
small lib it is easier to add some more functions in the future (like SMIME)
without changing the application code.

I find out that the java.sql driver framework is cool and doe's anythink we
need with to handle some security functions. In fact of this i create a
framework which looks first like java.sql. The main difference you can see
in the JSCFStatement class. Here are some statements defined we need to
integrate this framework into columba.

But hey! I can add some more statements if you need it and the statement is
general a security relevant statement.

Do you have questions?

Try it and fist reed the INSTALL file which should be included in any 
release. If there are other problems or ideas from you? 

Don't hesitate to drop me a message and i will find out what i can do for you:
