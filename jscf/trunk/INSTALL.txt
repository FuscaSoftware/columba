## ========== How to install this framework ==========

First of all: This is a Java Framework and it uses only java tools to compile
and create the framework and the examples.

# ===== What you need =====
The project is created with maven (http://maven.apache.org).

To build the project you need only maven. All other dependencies should
be automaticly installed from maven.

# ===== Hot to compile it =====
There is a default goal "jar" which is executed if you run simple

> maven

Do you have questions or the framework will not be build on your system?
