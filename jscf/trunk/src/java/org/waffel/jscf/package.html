In this package you can found the <b>J</b>ava <b>S</b>ecurity <b>C</b>omponent <b>F</b>ramework implementation.
The implementation is a hull for other real implementations like gpg command line implementation or something else.
The JSCF works like a generic JDBC driver framework where no real JDBC driver is given. The real JDBC drivers are 
provided from the database developers. The same is for JSCF. This is only a framework and the real implementation for
security operations should be provided from the tool developers.
<p>
But of course. You can find a small implementation for the gpg command line interface.
