GPG commandline wrapper implementation for the Java Security Component
Framework.
<p>You can have a look into the implementation, but please use the
JSCFramework to acess methods from this implementation. The gpg command
line tool is called as a system process call from java (no JINI) to make
some operations. This implementation has some more helper methods as
defined in the JSCF.</p>
