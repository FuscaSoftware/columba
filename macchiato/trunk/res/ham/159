On the other hand just doing server side stuff (filtering/spam
detection) doesn't mean that they don't want to do it on the client side
too. 

On the mailserver we have a site wide spamfilter, and I have a server
side sieve/procmail rule that puts all spams in the Spam folder. However
I can't change the rules they use to detect spam, so I want to do it on
the client too... (and not just on the inbox, as I do most filtering on
the server). So it would be nice to be able to do both spam filtering
and "ordinary" filtering on all folders automatically, not only the
inbox.

Combining server and client side spamfiltering, it would be nicer to
have a "real" Spam folder.
