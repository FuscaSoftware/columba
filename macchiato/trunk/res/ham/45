I'm trying to play an audio stream from the internet with a view to
capturing something from it to a file. I can play this stream with windows
media player or any number of other things but not with vlc. (the stream in
question is mms://203.167.213.229/coolblue). Attempting to play this using
vlc gets some sound but it is very broken up.

 

The message log generates a bunch of stuff which I have attached to this
message. 

 

If anyone has any ideas what is going on I'd appreciate the help.

 

BB.
