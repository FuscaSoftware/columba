The CPU utilization is 100 percent, so I understand and have to agree to th=
e
FAQ that this is a problem with the CPU. But why does Apples DVD-software
manage to play DVDs on the same computer and VLC doesn=B4t? Also my older iMa=
c
with a 400MHz CPU is able to play DVD with Apples software. Isn=B4t there
anything I can do about it? I would prefer to you use VLC instead of Apples
software.

Best regards,


Niklas B=E4umer
