I think the two best possible organizations (problems introduced by
legacy/crappy third-party software excepted) are:

 - A "Documents" or "Personal Files" on the desktop (~/Desktop) and
actually pointing to ~/

 - The desktop being ~/ itself and a Documents folder on it (actually in
~/Documents).

The second one being my favourite by far but it seems there are some
problems that make it impossible to consider a valid default.
