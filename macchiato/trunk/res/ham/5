mmmhhh.... But it's a script, not a simple dialog :-)

Beside IMHO you can't 'write' your first query using widget.

The query is:

(A+B)(C+D)[**] 


Using a GUI like the one (unused) in
rhythmbox/data/glade/create-playlist.glade you can only do
 
Where	A	[is]		xxx
[Or]	B	[is not]	yyy
[And]	C	[is]		zzz
[Or]	D	[is]		kkk

It should be A+BC+D, if the AND has precedence on OR as it should be.

So, i remember well boolean algebra

(A+B)(C+D) =
= (A+B)C+(A+B)D =
= AC+BC+AD+BC <>
<> A+BC+D

You need parenthesis!!

So, to be KISS, IMHO a simple [Match all!Match any] is the best for now.

Note that the second query is AB+C <> A(B+C) = AB+AC

[*]Note that I've only a screenshot of iTunes dialog
[**] == (A OR B)AND(C OR D)
     It's boolean algebra: AND==x OR==+
