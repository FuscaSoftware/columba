I'm not sure I understand what you want to do but I guess that, if you
need bigger pictures than 256x256, what you really need is a true
picture viewer (not a thumbnails generator). Thus, the best way to do it
would be to embed a view like EOG or gthumb do.

And yes: you need to be on crack if you really want to have "thumbnails"
larger than 256x256 :)
