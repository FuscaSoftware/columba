Dear Sir/Madame,
We are a group of students working on a research project on Video on 
Demand.  Our main focus is on stream merging techniques.  I was 
wondering if you can help us with this topic.  I wanted to know how the 
merging is done when many clients come in.  How is this techniques 
implemented.  I would like any documentation you can provide us.

Thank you very much.

Gunalan N
