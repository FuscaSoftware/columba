I don't parse that, "If you use the python
debugger" is the first condition and "if I use
jython" is the second, but the python debugger
runs *in* jython.

I've never debugged pushtotest code, but I have
debugged jython.

import pdb
pdb.set_trace()

will start the debugger at the point set_trace
is called.

pdb.

Nope.

There's good documentation on the python.org site.

Many of the jython modules are documented on
python.org, because that's where they came from
originally.

I find pdb is pretty good, except in threads
such as swing handlers.  Extending it to work
with threads and interface the Java 2.0 DBI
would be great.
