Hi Dan.

Thanks for writing.

You say that like cutesy is a bad thing. :) But yeah, I know what you
mean. First round of UI tests, we'll try "Details".

Thanks -- this is a good suggestion. I refined my prototype to this end
(link follows).

Ah, sorry, I created some unnecessary confusion here. 

I don't intend to make any ui changes to the free/busy widget (regarding
blocks of time per day, or capability of displaying multiple days at
once.) 

What I was thinking of doing is packing the list of attendees, and the
free/busy widget, into horizontal panes, to facilitate the user resizing
them at whim, to display as much or little information associated with
them as possible. I'd have to be clever about this so that the list of
attendees still lines up with the free/busy widget properly, but I think
it is possible.

As for the two blocks of time per day thing, I did not invent that
granularity. The current UI uses it. :-/ We probably need a few concrete
usage scenarios to figure out what the optimal scale is.

No, I didn't intend to remove it; I just lack data to decide where to
put it. How often do people change this? I believe that some of the
scheduling options would be well-placed in the menus.

So, have imported recurrences ever worked, then? (My understanding is
that they have always been broken.) It would help me to know how
imported recurrences are set, if indeed they can be.

I knew this would come up.

1) As you saw yesterday in #evo, Guenther translated recurrence strings
for us into German, and they were barely any longer than the English
ones. 

2) If we were clever with alignments (namely, if we make the "Repeat"
label align at y=0), then we can wrap the recurrence string in a
completely fine-looking way.

3) That said, I have no problem at all with moving the recurrence stuff
down to the bottom of the dialog, eg

Hmm. Well, I agree with you that I should have removed the "11:00" and
"12:00" from those combo boxes. But, I submit that the common meaning of
insensitive widgets is "These options exist but aren't relevant to you
right now", not "These widgets have no meaning". 

My thought with including them was that it made it clearer to the user
that it is *possible* to set start and end hours for an appointment. (If
you can't see them, then it is harder to know for certain whether or not
they exist.. no?) That said, we have to test this on humans anyway, so
I'll take care to measure reactions to this. 

Do you think that I am missing (or misunderstanding) your objection to
their presence?

I'll tell you, Dan, this one is a can of worms which I'm not eager to
open. This feels to me like we're going to have find a balance between
absolute adherence to the ical spec, and creating a simple and usable
UI. 

My sense so far (informed by engaging in dialogue with the people who
report using them) is that most of the people who use multiple alarms
use them "count down" style. They seem to repeat one type of alarm a few
times to ensure that they are prepared for an appointment (or a task) ..
but not to use different kinds of alarms. So what I'm wondering is if we
can get away with allowing a nice suite of repeating options for alarms,
instead of allowing truly "distinct" alarms. 

What do you think?

Thanks as always for your constructive, and thorough, feedback. Don't
know what I'd do without it. 

best, 
Anna
