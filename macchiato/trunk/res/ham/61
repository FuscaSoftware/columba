Hello,
I sort of have a question. This would be the perfect player, if only you =
could adjust the brightness and contrast. The plugins, video filter, =
adjust goes between 1 and 2 but when I change from 1-2; it makes no =
differance. A lot of movies are too dark and being able to adjust =
brightness and contrast would be great! I have the newest version of vlc =
- 6.2.
I have a movie that plays but the video is really screwed up and and vlc =
is the ONLY media player that it looked good in. (tried windows media =
player 9, light alloy 2.4, and newest bsplayer)

If this is considered an article or comment--you have my permission to =
use it.

                                  Sincerely,
                                 Virginia Demo
