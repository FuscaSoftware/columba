Jean-Paul,
Thnx for your reply.Constraints involved in the availibilty
of the test equipment makes me reply late and i apologize
for it. 
I tried running the same .trp files on a different PC and it
works but blocks in between and once blocked , is unable to
continue.

Heres what  is displayed in the messages as i try to run the
..trp file:

PTS is out of range (8210966706), dropping buffer
PTS is out of range (8210942758), dropping buffer
PTS is out of range (8210918831), dropping buffer
late picture skipped (486580)
...
...
...
...
.....

As i found on an earlier post, this should be coz the system
is slow and the decoder is unable to receive the packets on
time.
Could there be another reason and what could be the possible
solution?
Thnx a lot,
JS
