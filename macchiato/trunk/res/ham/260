I'm running nVidia driver with Evo 1.4 under RH 7.3 without that
problem.

You might check to see you have a recent driver. Some of the earlier
ones were alternatively squirrely for either 3D OpenGL apps or plain old
2D X stuff. The 4496 one seems pretty good to me so far.

I have:
glxinfo | grep 'OpenGL version string'
OpenGL version string: 1.4.0 NVIDIA 44.96
