Hi,
      On a computer with VLC everything works fine. On a AmiNET 103 box,
I get no audio, and get blocky video. I tried a sample video from
videolan.org as well as a ripped DVD. 
              Both had the same results. With the ripped DVD I had a
network transfer of approx 1.3Mb and 800 - 900kb with the
(THX_Cimmarron.vob) from videolan.org. 
              I feel the network is fine. VLC on a computer I couldn't
check the audio though, since I did not have a Sound Card on the computer.
          Thanks
Manu
