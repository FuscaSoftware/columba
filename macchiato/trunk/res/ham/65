Quoting Jean-Paul Saman <saman@natlab.research.philips.com>:

OK. I tried again with the following commandline:

/usr/local/bin/vlc -vvv --program 512 terrestrial:714000000:0:3:27500000

(This should be YLE TV 1 here in Finland. "dvbstream -f 714000 -ps 512
650 -o | mplayer -" confirms that.)

Well, it also says that the frequency is invalid:

[00000157] dvb input warning: invalid frequency 714000000 (Hz), using
default one

Yes. dvbstream + mplayer works like a charm.

Yes. I'm aware of that, but AFAIK vls uses it, does it not?

Any tools for finding out this that you know of?

OK. I tried that, and it seems to use the OFDM frontend, but it still fails.
