Of course, it would be cooler to make an app that creates a window or
panel applet or something, which you can drag messages to and it will
convert them directly. :)

You can't do it easily directly from perl. You'll need to write a C
program and use libcalclient (and beware that you'll have to rewrite it
for Evolution 2.0 because the API will be changing).

The source is in calendar/cal-client/ in the evolution source tree.
There is some documentation in the source files in the form of
gtk-doc-style comments. Basically you'll want to use cal_client_new() to
create a CalClient object, then cal_client_open_default_calendar() or
cal_client_open_default_tasks() to open the default calendar or tasks
folder with that client object. Then use cal_client_update_object() to
create the new appointment/task.

Well, ok, so cal_client_update_object() takes a CalComponent, so you'll
need to use libcal-util as well. There's no function to directly create
a CalComponent from an ical string, so you'll need to first create an
icalcomponent (using icalcomponent_new_from_string() in libical) and
then call cal_component_set_icalcomponent(). Or you could just build up
the CalComponent using the cal_component_set_* functions instead of
creating an icalendar string.

The client-test.c code in calendar/cal-client has some code you can use
as a starting point.
