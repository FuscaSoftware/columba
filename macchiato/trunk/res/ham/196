Hi all,

I have a pc with 2 ethernet cards in order to streaming using vls. I
would like to stream using only one ethernet interface, leaving the
other one free (but I want this interface up, because I want to
monitorize this machine through it).

I think there is a bug here. Stream is sent sometimes through one
interface and sometimes through the other one. I have tried to use the
'interface' channel option, but I have the same result.

Anyone can help me, please?
Mariano.
