Right, that's also my understanding.  But the question is, when do you
want the alarm to trigger?
Let's say it takes you 2 hours to do the test. Would you like the alarm
trigger say 4 hours before close of business on November 30. Or would
you like a general reminder before 1st of October that you have to have
your car checked.
Maybe there should be an option to  set the alarm for due or start
date/times, otherwise it will be utterly confusing for new users.
I made just a rule for me on how to use it since there was only one
option without editing the isc file and maybe I'm biased to that
solution since I'm used it.
