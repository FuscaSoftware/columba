ha, interesting.

so shouldn't context menu then have only/mostly items which doesn't
apply on all messages, but are defined by context? spam flag
setting/unsetting should go there then. while for example "Reply" is not
context sensitive, you may reply to any message. I am probably taking
this too far, but it may be good criteria for reducing that menu?
