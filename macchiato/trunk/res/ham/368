A point of clarification: This checkbox should not disable the ability
to reclassify spam/ham.  In my case, filtering incoming messages is a
complete waste of time, as I run my spam filter on the server.  But
being able to easily reclassify messages for the server (via an
appropriate plugin) would somewhat useful.

Seems like pure geek eye-candy to me.  What would be the possible
utility for Average Joe User?  If you really want to see the score, just
display the message headers (almost all spam filters have the ability to
add a spam-score type header to the message).

It's OK as long as it's consistent (i.e. putting a message in the spam
folder automatically classifies it as spam, and removing it
automatically classifies it as non-spam).

I'll go a step further and state that IMO it's the only way to implement
spam filtering that's worth doing.  If it's not pluggable, don't bother.

I think it should be specified that these pointers are allowed to be
NULL, and are simply not called in that case.  (I can see an immediate
utility for a plugin that doesn't implement "check_spam", but that does
implement both the "report_" routines).

Also, there needs to be some way to *re*classify spam/ham, ala
bogofilter (i.e. remove it from the spam database, and enter it into the
ham database).  This could be two new entrypoints:

 	void     (*reclassify_spam)   (CamelMimeMessage *message);
	void     (*reclassify_nospam) (CamelMimeMessage *message);

Or, could be an additional argument to the "report_*" methods:

	void     (*report_spam)   (CamelMimeMessage *message, gboolean reclassify)=
;
	void     (*report_nospam) (CamelMimeMessage *message, gboolean reclassify)=
;

I think it would be *much* simpler to identify spam by what folder it's
in (kinda like presence in the "Drafts" folder currently identifies an
unfinished message), and leave message headers (or any munging of the
message contents) completely out of this.  This concept obviously
requires that the user have the ability to specify which folder(s)
contain "spam" -- maybe this could be added to the "Defaults" tab in the
account editor (ala the "drafts" folder)?

Well, using a vfolder pretty much dictates that the implementation muck
with the message to mark it as spam somehow (which, as I just stated,
would be much more complicated than simply moving the message to a
specific folder).  Not using vfolders would allow the implementation to
co-exist with other server-side spam filtering/classification techniques
(so I'd vote for *not* using vfolders).

Ack -- that's just what I need -- double the number of places that spam
is displayed...  No thanks ;o)

Yay!  Less complexity =3D=3D goodness.

I can't think of any reason to display spam in two places (in fact,
doing so seems to defeat the whole purpose of spam filtering in the
first place, doesn't it?).
