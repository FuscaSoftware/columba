Hi Anna,

Overall the dialogs look nice. I have a few suggestions/questions
though.

Looks nice, but the middle of the dialog seems a little crowded with all
the different controls. Could you  move some of them to the bottom. I
think that might also help people who tab through the dialog by keeping
the most often modified fields near the top.

So for example:
--
What:  [           ]
Start: [8/13/2003] [11:00]  End:  [8/13/2003] [12:00]  []All day event

Where: [          ]

Why:   [           ]

Alarms: [None]         Repeats: [Never]

Calendar: [       ]  [x]Mark me as busy

[Public] [Categories:                              ]
--
For me this orders the fields from top to bottom by how often I make
entries in or modify them. I'm not sure how we're handling the Calendar
field, I'm assuming it would have the calendar you were viewing when you
created the appointment. 

There are no timezone buttons for the start and end times. Was this
intentional?

It might be nice if there was some way of indicating in the initial view
whether this is an appointment just for me or a multi-person meeting.
I'm not sure what the best way to do that would be, maybe change the
appearance of the Scheduling tab?

One of my pet peeves, are we going to fix the time drop down lists so
you don't get this huge long list of times that goes to the bottom of
your screen.

To be honest I have never liked the table view with horizontal rows for
each persons free/busy information. I find it hard to navigate,
especially when zooming in/out or trying to move between different days
or weeks. The scrolling can get very laborious! I have had the thought
for a while that presenting the free/busy information in the regular
day/week/month views would be much better. 

Something like

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[list       ]
[of         ]
[attendees ]

|
|  calendar day/week view 
|  with attendees F/B information
|

[meeting start time]  [autopick]
[meeting end time]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Though that would however require more screen space :(. 

Anyway some suggestions/question for the current view

- Are we dropping the Role and RSVP fields?
- Will F/B automatically refresh at some interval? There used to be a
button.
- There were options for Autopick ( All people and resources, Required
people, etc. ), are we dropping that as well. I personally never changed
those options ( except when testing them ) so I won't miss them. 
- There does not appear to be a way to change the organizer of the
meeting. Will that now strictly be based on what calendar the meeting is
created in? Or will you be able to change that in the list of attendees?
If I recall correctly the Organizer does not have to be an attendee?
This is the way Evolution used to work, we changed that for SunOne. Also
having the organizer in a separate field made it easier to quickly see
who had created the meeting. If this gets put back in, it might go
better in Appointment tab ( see may earlier note about telling the
different between appointments and meetings ).
- Will the + button open the "Select contacts from address book" dialog?
If it will then the "Address book" button seems somewhat redundant. Also
which addressbook will it open, since I thought we were moving away from
having default folders.
- It might be nice to have ways to navigate the F/B information besides
just scrolling. A jump to next day/week or select date button?
- Have the date in the date row of the F/B table "float". Right now the
date seems to be anchored to the start of the day. Currently with the
view zoomed out and show non-working hours displayed you can scroll the
date out of view. 
- dan's question about zooming out, does it include non-working hours.

- I agree with Dan's suggestion to add back the preview calendar, with
the addition that it would be nice to be able to add exceptions right
from the preview calendar. For example have the "Add exception" button
be deactivated until the person clicks on a date with a meeting
recurrence in the preview calendar.
- If you have more than one exception how will they be listed? The old
UI had a table view.
