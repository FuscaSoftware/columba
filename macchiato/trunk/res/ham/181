To whomever it may concern,

    I recently stated working for foreign television and am sent movie files 
from abroad which use subtitles. Up until recently I have had no problem 
with Videolan whatsoever until I was sent a file using OGG format.
  The problem I had was that VLC would not play the videofile with timecode, 
it would not produce a track which my subtitle format would play.
  I was wondering whether you could tell me whether this was the file or 
your program and could you advise me on the next course of action, as far as 
I know the file is rendered perfectly using your software it is just solving 
the problem of time.
  In other packages I used the file was jumpy when i installed vosub and 
Xvid rendering codecs.

It would be most helpful if you could help me resolve this problem as I 
don't speak Chinese so it is difficult to explain to my employer the 
concerns I am having.


Thank you

A.Lopez
