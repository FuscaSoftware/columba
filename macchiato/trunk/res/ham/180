I am new to VLC and all I want to do is stream a live feed from my Osprey
100 video capture card.  I have VLC installed on a new Windows2000Pro box
and I have DirectX9.  Everything is up to date and the Osprey card works
fine with Real Producer, Windows Encoder, DirectShow, VidCap.exe
AmCap.exe... but I don't know how to get it to work with VLC.  Any ideas
would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks so much,
James
