Yes it supports it.

You'll have to use the latest stable of vlc for the streaming part. 
Unfortunately the VLC rpm's are build for RH 9.0. You'll have two 
choices here:
1) Update your RH 7.3 server to RH 9.0
2) Compile vlc from source (you'll also need the additional libraries 
and projects from the contrib directory).

On the (iPaq) client part, you can use the latest stable for Familiar v6.x.
