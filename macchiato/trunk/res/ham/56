This might indicate a problem in the encoding of the stream, rather then 
a too slow computer.

On occasional skip of pictures and even quite a lot of skipped pictures 
is not that worrying. Because usually there are enough pictures to 
display a movie. But you are right it does mean that the computer is not 
fast enough to decode ALL pictures.

If vlc logs complain about a too slow computer then you are really in 
trouble and using faster hardware definitely helps.

As I said above the line " PTS is out of range .." line is worrying. 
Could you try with one of our sample streams from the videolan website ?
One of the mpeg for instance from: 
http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/streams/dolby_trailers/*.mpeg

I think these videos will be allright, but your sample .trp file is 
messed up. But please test as I suggest so we can narrow it down.
