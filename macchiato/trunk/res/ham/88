Ok I missed the log line.

Yep VLS uses it, but not this version of libdvb. AFAIK it uses only 
version libdvb-0.2.0

Use the probe option from the dvb access plugin.

No there is nothing wrong with your configure settings. It is a bug in 
my dvb access code. And dvb-t uses other frequencies then dvb-s.

So pull the latest version from the CVS. I have just made some 
modifications to the dvb access plugin.

No they are seperate things, please do not mix them. DVB API for Linux 
is build on top of V4L2.

You must provide the upper and lower frequencies for your DVB-T tuner. 
The defaults used are for DVB-S which of course will not work in your 
case. Add --lnb-lof1, --lnb-lof2 and --lnb-slof to the commandline, with 
correct values. Thus:

/usr/local/bin/vlc -vvv --program 512 terrestrial:714000000:0:3:27500000 
--lnb-lof2=715000000 --lnb-lof1=9750000 --lnb-slof=11700000

Actually the values for --lnb-lof1 and --lnb-slof are still the default 
ones in the example above. You'll have to find out which your Nova-T 
uses with vlc terrestrial:714000000:0:3:27500000 --probe

Here is some small legenda:
--lnb-lof1	lowest frequency allowed for tuner
--lnb-lof2	highest frequency allowed for tuner
--lnb-slof	frequency at which to switch between low and higband

Yep.

Indeed it does.
