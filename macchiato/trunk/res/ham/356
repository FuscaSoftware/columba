Cool stuff. Any chance you could hint about what you want to use this
for? :)

Mostly, yes. However, as I'd like to point out, I much prefer any actual
vfs backend to be as true to the filesystem idea as possible. Already
the semantics of file handling using gnome-vfs is a bit vague, and for
every vfs backend with strange filesystems semantics the less reliable
gnome-vfs will be. A vfs backend is used by applications, and
application writers need to be able to rely on some standard semantics,
or they'll easily get confused. (Nautilus already has to have
workarounds for some wonky behaviour in the vfolder vfs backend.)

Also, adding vfs extensions in this way doesn't really integrate that
well in the system at the moment. You have to *know* the new uri is
there and manually type it in (or follow some link someone else made).
The plans for Gnome 2.6 is to allow some vfs methods to emit "I'm now
availible" signals in some way so that something can become visible in
the UI. This is meant to be used for plugging in e.g. hardware that
stores files, but isn't mountable as a normal unix filesystem. Used for
things like non-usb-storage cameras, mp3-players etc. You just plug em
in, and you get an icon on the desktop and in the nautilus tree.

Also, we hope in the future we'll be able to hide the vfs URIs from the
user interface a bit better.

You can also add a script to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/, but this is
meant more for users or sysadmins.

There is no way to do this currently. However, we have realized that
views, as they exist now, are pretty useless when it comes to extending
nautilus since you have to reimplement everything to have a view that
isn't broken. What most people really want is to be able to modify the
standard directory views. So, for Gnome 2.6 we're gonna make a new
plugin system that allows you to do things like add columns to the list
view and otherwise add to the directory views. Dave Camp is working on
this, and if you have any specific wishes you should talk to him so that
the new design allows you to do what you want.

So, really we want people to sort of ignore views, at least for
directories, and tell us what sort of extensions they want to do of the
standard directory views.

The tree is not supposed to be related to what is currently visible in
the view. Its supposed to be more of a global view of the system,
containing all the filesystem "roots" of the system. So, if you plug in
a CD it'll show up there. This is much like the letter-drives in a
windows system. Currently the tree is hardcoded to only show /, $home
and removable media mountpoints, but as I discussed about VFS above, in
the future we want to allow non-file:// gnome-vfs to signal that
something has been "mounted", which means it'll show up in the tree.

Also, the roots listed in the tree isn't only shown there, they will
also appear in the file selector and other places.

There is currently work going on in Gtk+ for a new fileselector dialog.
This dialog has the filesystem abstracted out, and there is a gnome-vfs
based implementation for it. The idea is that this automatically gets
used for Gnome apps, so you'll get much wider integration of gnome-vfs.

Thanks.
