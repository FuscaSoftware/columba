there are a few problems with some special recurrence settings in 1.4.x,
in the file backend. I am working on fixing all those cases right now
for 2.x, so we should expect all kinds of recurrences to work in 2.0

well, since we are supporting more and more backends, most of them using
ical spec, I think we should have some way to view/edit events/tasks
created in more complicated UIs. I agree that having it as easier as
possible is a good goal, but we should also take into account that we
are going to allow the modification of "weird" events/tasks via the
connectors.
