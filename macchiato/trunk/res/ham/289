SRT subs in OGM are not using unicode, so even if VLC could play them, i 
guess you would run into trouble unless you are using a chinese windows. 
Somebody with a better knowledge about this stuff please correct me if 
i'm wrong.

Point your employees to www.matroska.org, all relevant tools to create 
MKV files convert SRT subs to unicode during muxing, so all you need is 
the chinese language support on your machine to play them.
