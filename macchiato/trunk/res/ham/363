I counted on previous discussion here, IIRC it was suggested that in
offline mode we have whole messages (so we can filter while they are
downloaded) and in case we have only headers available, the message is
filtered when displayed - so message is identified as spam at that time
- seems pretty inconvenient, but it's the price for speed. Also IIRC
Michael have a patch for switching full download on and off. So we can
use this option. Then the question really is what to make default
behavior, full download or headers-only. My opinion is to make full
download as default, but I am not 100% sure about this.

Yes, I meant such a flag. It will be stored in folder summary file,
which is local, right?

After reading all the answers I am convinced that Spam vFolder will be
better than regular folder as it will avoid moving remote messages to
[local] Spam folder (wherever it should have been located).

I just wanted describe that 1st available filter plugin will be selected
by default. I guess we can even link some of plugin(s) to evolution and
in that case it should default to that/best one.

option specific to selected plugin (local tests only for spamassassin,
....)

yes, it will allow people to customize it for their needs, like filter
only personal mail, move all spam to their preferred folder, etc.

We should have also "Is spam" filter rule which will use spam flag.

ah, didn't know that. hmm, so I guess I have to make vFolder be
specified by Spam flag then. Do you know if adding it to local files has
any use? I don't see any right now.

Zucchi says it's pretty fast. Cool.

I think it's better to hide them, at least as default. Do you think that
showing them has any advantage/possible use?

I was thinking about applying filters on it, but now I am for vFolder
scenario.
