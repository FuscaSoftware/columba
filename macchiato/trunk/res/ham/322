Hi,

Probably it's been asked already a million times, but also i want to 
move over from Windows to Linux using Evolution.

How do i get my mail from Outlook XP to Evolution 1.4?

I've tried the following:

Create mbox format with libPST:
libPST "forgets" some folders and it's not possible to get these folders 
seperately. Also it cannot handle the HTML mail i have received in 
Outlook. Evolution complains that it cannot handle the MIME type and 
displays the mail as source which shows nothing.

The Mozilla solution:
Installed Mozilla on Windows, imported my Outlook mail, copied the 
Mozilla files to the Linux partition in the ~/.mozilla directory, but 
the mails don't show up in Mozilla. I checked the export options in 
Mozilla and no mbox export format.

The Outlook Express solution:
I imported all my Outlook mail in Outlook Express 6, converted the dbx 
files into mbx files and copied those over on the Linux partition. There 
is no way i can import the mbx files into Evolution.

The IMAP solution:
I guess i have to try that one as a last resort. I will set up an IMAP 
server, move my mail in there and download it then into Evolution.

Why is it so difficult to move the mail?
What is a working solution without having to set up a seperate 
mailserver for that?
Is there a step-by-step-because-i-feel-like-a-dummy guide how to do this 
process?

Any help is welcome!!

Ton.
