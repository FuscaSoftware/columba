Ooh, yeah, I hate that. Even just fixing it so that when it popped up,
the currently-selected time was scrolled to the top of the list, would
be a huge improvement. But there still must be some nicer UI for picking
a time...

Well... you don't really need to have the summary text in the calendar
in this case, since you only care about free vs busy. So that would let
us squish it down some...

If we're thinking of changing the free/busy UI at all, it occurs to me
that our use of color there is probably non-a11y-compliant.

Do you ever use the button? It's really only necessary if you leave the
window open long enough that the other participants change their
calendars.
