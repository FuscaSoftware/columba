Hi,
           I don't get any audio, and my video has lot of rectangle
blocks. I'm using an Aminocom 103 set top Box to play (multicast). I
heard   that it may be due to a higher bit rate than the Set top box can
handle. The Box supports 8MBps(Bits). I'm using 900kbps(Bytes) approx
7MBps. I tried a smaller res video also 500kbps approx 4MBps, still the
same, no difference at all.
                  Any ideas why it might be happening ? The Videolan
Manual says that the folks have successfully tested it ? If somebody
could help out, would be great ...

Thanks,
 Manu
