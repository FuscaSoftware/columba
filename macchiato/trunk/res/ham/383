You can define the simple API without having to implement plug-ins.=20
Then if it's necessary you can plug-in-ify it later.

You can have a clean design without making it pluggable.

We don't have much time to 2.0.  You have to minimize the risk -- which
doesn't mean doing a crappy job at it, it just means not aiming for
generic blue-sky pluggability when there is no contingent reason for it.

Write the code so that it's easy to add support for different spam
systems, document it, and leave it at that.

Simplicity always pays off.

Fine, so it's our job to pick the one that works best, and make
Evolution use it.

Then let's make it library based, I don't care.  But focus on making
Spamassassin work best.

This has been discussed before, I don't want to have another argument
about this.
