Well in iTunes there are 3 layers :-) take a look at 
http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview.html

I think this icon wants to 'extended' the playlist icon. 

A playlist is just like a single file in the iTunes/Rb internal: you can
create, rename, remove. It's a 'single' entity.

Library is more then a playlist, so...

Note: there are just 2 layer 'cause I'm very lazy :-P 
But if we want this one we can make each 'layer bigger (2 or 3 pxl)

The alternate idea is:
      * use rb-playlist-alt.png (the simple rectangular+eye paper)
      * use a single 'layer' icon for library (note that it's not a
        piece of paper and it's not rectangular. You can find a good
        exaple at
        gnome-icon-theme/24x24/stock/object/stock_insert-sound-plugin.png)

Yeah, no antialiasing and done in 5 minutes.

I remember a satellite antenna in jimmac website, probably something for
Ximian Red Carpet Channels 

But IMHO keep the same "background" of library can be useful. iRadio
station are maneged as music files in library.
