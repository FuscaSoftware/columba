Hi Rodrigo,
actually Not Zed described this design a few month/weeks (can't
remember) in an email.  To make a long story short, you have to get the
composer out of the address space from the shell otherwise the result is
undefined, works in 1.2.x kind of. But definitely  doesn't work under
1.4.X, I tried really hard but Not Zed was right in his email, iirc it
was to  a question from somebody from Sun who also was running into
problems on getting the composer working, seems he never implemented Not
Zed suggestions, so I did. In other words itip-utils works only because
you run it under the shell, but it's not a general solution.

I thought somebody was already implementing a general solution for
getting interfaces from the shell(?) for 2.0, at least according to the
email from Not Zed mentioned above.
I see my implementation as a point solution for _my_ (and maybe for for
other people who need a working composer from outside evolution) problem
under 1.4 not as a general solution. Adding a method for every interface
one might need to get to extend evolution would really s... 
Thanks for the response,
Ronald
