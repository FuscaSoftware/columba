This is the right version.

It doesn't say it is an invalid frequency it says that tuning failed.

Can you tune to this channel with your dvbstream + mplayer setup ?

..dvbrc file is not useable with vlc. It is simply not used.

Do not know ?

I rather have the full log then a selection, so I do not have a problem 
with it.

Try without sout first please.

You mentioned you have a Nova-T so you are using terrestrial dvb instead 
of satellite!! VLC thinks you are using a QPSK (satellite frontend), 
that is where 'dvb' defaults to. See the log:

So use vlc like this:

/usr/local/bin/vlc -vvv --program 8211 terrestrial:12597000:0:3:27500000

Now VLC should try to tune the frontend (FE_OFDM) for tuning. It hasn't 
have much testing yet, so could you report success or failure back to 
this list please? (with logs of course ;-))
