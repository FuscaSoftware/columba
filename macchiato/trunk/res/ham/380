The UI is described in my mail, in 1st section. You may select
filter(plugin) in Settings dialog. It will default to 1st installed
filter or to a filter linked to evo.

There nothing different in the UI (besides possibility to have
different/specific options)

They don't have to care. It has good defaults, you have to care only if
you don't like the default filter used. Then you have a choice to use
different plugin.

I am not wasting time. Making it plugable lets me to define simple API.
If I don't do it that way, it may be impossible to make it plugable
later and will cost us more time.

Why?

I don't see any added complexity there. Also I will be hacking this so
please keep me my freedom of choice how to implement it.

There are at least 3 major one people are using (bogofilter,
spamassassin and spamprobe).

I am not sure I understand what do you mean here.

I am of course aware of this. What I was not sure about was the
performance of vFolder vs. moving of 10% spam messages. Michael
clarified this and Jeff brought another reasons why using vFolder will
be useful.

Your "pluggability" using gconf keys doesn't seems clean to me. also
bogofilter is written in C so it may be possible to build plugin which
will not need exec bogofilter command line tool. Also IIRC spamassassin
has a library to communicate with spamassassin's daemon.

I am not yet sure about this.
