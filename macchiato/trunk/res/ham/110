That URL is wrong for a start, this is better:

  ssh://username@host.domain/home/students/username/

The other thing to check is that you need passwordless keys, as ssh:
doesn't support asking for the password.  Try ssh'ing to the machine
from a terminal, and if it asks for a passphrase, run ssh-agent/ssh-add.

You could also try gnome-vfs-sftp (in sid) which uses SFTP instead. This
method has a different set of bugs, but will actually prompt for the
passphrase as long as ssh-askpass-gnome is installed.
