OK. Works like a charm. I can watch all channels on the TS. I haven't
tried streaming yet, but I suppose that since I get vlc to display the
dvb-t broadcast, I should be able to get it to stream as well.

No. Thank you for your quick and helpful replies. You have saved me tons
of time. Thank you very much.

Ignore this. It was a stupid-user-error :) I thought that it would start
playing the program immediately, so all I had to do was click view ->
program...

That worked well, too.

No, the program is correct, but the receiving here is really bad. DVB-T
inside a brick building, with the window facing the "wrong" way (away
from the link tower..). The image gets pretty distorted at times, and
sometimes there's no reception at all, so I think it's because of that.

Anyway, thanks for the help. I'll try to get the streaming to work on
monday, so it might be that I'm going to be posting here again then.. :)
