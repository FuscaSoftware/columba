I didn't mean to come down on Tony.

Although I realize that the possibilities with 
LDAP are endless, I don't think its too terrible
to start to put together simple examples to help
someone just starting out, to get integrated.

Actually I found the OpenLDAP configuration to
be the easiest part. I probably don't have a DIT
that will work long term, but that wasn't my goal.

It was those Evo gotchas like the v2 bind, and
the flakiness of the connection code that drove me
crazy.

Those are the things that could be captured in
an example so others don't pull their hair out.

I would happily write up an example myself, if
someone could direct me where it would be best
hosted. Submit it to OpenLDAP? Ximian? Somewhere else?
