Dear Fellow Netpreneur...

I thought that you might be interested  in this...

A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.

The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
seriously.

Anyway, near the end of the month I received a letter from my
sponsor (Neil Barrett) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!

As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?

I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Neil asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)

Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!
All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.

You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!
I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!
With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS .
My sponsor's check, which is already at $1,000(and growing), arrives every
month...on time.
How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?
It's Really Easy:

Warm regards
Tim 

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the 'Net.
Their revolutionary Vertical Integration plan is amazing and
GUARANTEES that you will have PAID members placed in your
downline.
Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE. Just join Post launch now for FREE.
Nothing more to it.
