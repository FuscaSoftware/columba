d the benefits of these treatment therapies by logging on to the <b>&quot;=

90-day supply to patients for the full treatment program. Included in the =
kit is an instructional video on the treatment therapy allowing the patien=
t to use these products in their home. The therapies, when used as instruc=
ted, achieve a <b>success rate of eradication in excess of 90% with no sid=
e effects of any consequence</b>. Previously, these therapies and associat=
ed products were only available through the two prototype clinics in Utah.=
 The availability of these products will open the way for family practitio=
ners, pediatricians, internists and other primary care physicians to retai=
n their patients under their care during the treatment of these common ski=
n disorders. <b>The benefit to insurance providers is the potential to sav=
