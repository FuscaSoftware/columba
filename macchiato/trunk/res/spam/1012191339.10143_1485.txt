Dear bruceg@em.ca,


Hi there! 

May we send you information on our Home & Internet Based Business? 

Your name was on a list we purchased stating you were interested in 
Working from Home Opportunities or Internet Based Business's.

The information is free and without obligation. We will only send "ONE"
email and will not flood your mailbox with alot of junk.

We thought we would ask if you were still interested in the information
rather than just sending it. We know people's needs change.

We also understand that sometimes people's addresses end up on a list
they did not subscribe to, that is why we ask to make sure.

We are sorry for any inconvience this may have caused.

Simply click reply and change the subject line to say MORE INFO or YES.

Your information will be sent shortly.

Thanks and have a Great day.

Paul Bickwermert
