=======================================

Dear Internet User,

CIRA, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, has announced that on January 24 2002 (12 noon, eastern time), .CA domains that have NOT been renewed will be released to the general public for re-registration. Over 20,000 .ca names will be released and many Canadians who did not get the .CA names of their choice before, now have a second chance.  We are currently accepting re-registration and pre-booking requests for these .CA names at http://www.theGoodDomains.com.  There is NO EXTRA FEE to pre-book and when registration opens, our system will automatically submit your name on a first come first serve basis the minute they are released.



Sincerely,


TheGoodDomains.com

Note:  The Registry servers may be unavailable at times due to overload volumes.  If this is the case, please submit your requests by fax as below.  A complete list of the names available can be found at our website.
