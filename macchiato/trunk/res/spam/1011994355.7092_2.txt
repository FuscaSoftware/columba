You don't need to lose weight!  
 
     I'm sure you are quite comfortable being 
sluggish and slow and having a "lack of energy".  
 
     I'm sure those lonely nights give you a moment 
of peace and quite from your hectic days.
  
     You don't need to lose weight.  After all you probably 
have only another 5 or 6 years to live.  You don't need 
to lose weight, you can always find more material for 
the clothes you wear. Another size doesn't really matter.  
 
     But, oh the good food, that's the thing.   You want to 
eat more than you possibly need and make certain 
you don't exercise.  Because the bigger you become 
the more benefit your life has.  
 
*** If all of that above is true, then don't respond to this email.  
 
     But if it isn't, if any of those things above concern you, 
if while you are sitting at your computer you wonder 
why you aren't  out dancing, or you wonder why you 
are there instead of on a trip to somewhere.  Then respond to
this email and learn more about HGH.
 
     Nothing works unless you wish it to.  There is no easy road. 
But the product I have will encourage you to keep on the ones that work.
 
     HGH, in thousands of clinical studies, has been proven to increase your 
strength, energy, memory, and sex drive!
 
     Plus, lose fat, water weight and reduce wrinkles.
 
Also, and most importantly feel:
     Happy and Alive.
