ARE YOU BURNING YOUR BRAIN? GET THE PHONE DOME - ABSORBS 99% OF 
HARMFUL RADIATION 

www.thephonedome.com

Mobile / Cell phones are bad for you - everyone knows it and research 
has proven links with several forms of cancer. The world's leading 
phone makers have even agreed to start publishing information about 
the levels of radiation emitted by their phones. Recently launched 
the PHONE DOME, a tiny anti-radiation safety accessory made up of 
micro crystals that neutralise and change the negative effects of all 
mobile/cell phones reducing harmful radiation by over 99% without any 
adverse effects on the phone's functionality. Acting as an energy 
cell the PHONE DOME creates a positive energy cell alteration within 
the radiation fields emitted from the mobile/cell phones. The PHONE 
DOME weighs less than a paperclip and simply sticks onto the back of 
a phone.

"The PHONE DOME is a Bio-Radiation shield the size of a button easily 
attached to a mobile phone…for transforming the negative emissions 
and thereby helping to protect you." John G Walker. H.F Rad. A.I.C.R.
S.Hom. RADIONICS Expert.
