STREET BISHOPS, a U.S. based international ministry, has the authority to ORDAIN you this week.  We are a ministry dedicated to serving the needs of emerging clergy with credentials, business practices support, supplies, guidence, and other resources leading to a successful ministry.  

STREET BISHOPS believes that ordination should be given to all who ask, regardless of their theological thought, as long as they are committed to serving the hearts and minds of man, following the guidance and Love of God. One of the benefits of being a LEGAL member of the clergy, you will be authorized to perform the rites and ceremonies of the church. They include:

WEDDINGS - You can earn part-time income officiating marriages on weekends. Couples are searching for a wedding officiates. Most states require that you register your certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) prior to conducting the ceremony. And we have thousands of inquiries each year requesting ministers all over the country to conduct weddings - we can place you in our database of available officiates! One pastor works full time as a wedding officiate, so can you!

FUNERALS - The simple fact is that people die every day, providing a never-ending need for funeral officiates. Whether its for a friend, family member, or community member, you can fulfill a spiritual as well as community service. Don't settle for a minister you don't know!! Most states require that you register your certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) with the state prior to conducting the ceremony.

BAPTISMS - What a special way to welcome a child of God. As millions return to church and desire these official ceremonies, you are there to assist them! This adds to your part or full time income as a minister!

PASTORAL COULSELING - Just as clergy have for centuries been advisors, you too can enjoy limited privileges as a pastoral counselor assisting individuals in their time of need. You can be the one to guide hurting individuals towards healing through intervention by God.

CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES - PRISON MINISTRIES - Since you will be a Certified Minister, you can visit others in need. Preach the Word of God to those who have strayed from the flock, who are ready to CHANGE their lives - You can play a major part in that decision!

HOSPITOL MINISTRIES - A an ordained clergy, you can be listed with most hospitals and conduct a successful hospital ministry. 

WANT TO START YOUR OWN CHURCH? After your ordination, you may start your own congregation! We can offer much assistance as you begin your new place of worship.

WHICH RELIGION? Street Bishops is an interdenominational/interfaith association. We have ordained Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and other traditions serving God. By serving people you serve The Creator, within your own chosen tradition. 

COMMUNITY - You are joining a community of believers that are back to the basics. Serving others is a priority of our Clergy, come and join out community of service pastors. You will have an opportunity to be listed in the International Street Bishops Directory of Clergy so that you can share ideas, thoughts, and ask questions of your peer clergy around the world!
