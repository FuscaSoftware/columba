ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION HOLDING CORP. (OTCBB : ERHC)

URGENT BUY AT $ .26 PER SHARE!

SELL TARGET $1.20 PER SHARE!

ERHC, our top undervalued HOT PICK, controls a huge working interest
in some of the richest offshore oil blocks in West Africa.

Bidding wars have already developed between major oil companies such
as Shell, ChevronTexaco, Conoco, ExxonMobil, Phillips, and Marathon
who are willing to pay Hundreds of Millions of dollars to drill in
these zones and partner with ERHC.

ERHC's exclusive right to participate in exploration and production
along with oil industry giants could be worth up to FIFTY MILLION 
DOLLARS as these oil blocks are adjacent to Billion Barrel producing
regions!

Our track record proves we offer valuable research that builds your
wealth.  We target serious gains for serious investors with a 500%
investment return on ERHC.
